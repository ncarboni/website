# PhD

My research group explores topics across digital heritage/humanities, cultural analytics, and informatics, with a special focus on the use and development of computational tools and methods for studying the past. Examples include but are not limited to Data Science, Network Science, GIS, Knowledge Representation, Linked Data/Knowledge Graph, and genAI. 

I look for students who are curious and would like to work across disciplines. If you have a strong background in programming or technical skills, thatâ€™s great. However, it is not a requirement. I also value students with a strong humanistic background, specifically in art history, cultural studies, and heritage science.

If you're thinking about joining the group, feel free to send me a brief email outlining your research interests. You can reach me at carboni at illinois dot edu. While I may not be able to reply to every message, I do keep track of expressions of interest.

For those interested in working with me, the best way is to [apply to the PhD program at the iSchool](https://ischool.illinois.edu/degrees-programs/graduate/phd-information-sciences/apply) and list me as an advisor.
 

# Other opportunities 

**RAships**: Occasionally I may have paid research opportunities for students (both graduate and undergraduate). When I do, I circulate them to relevant departments/school on campus, on LinkedIn and here. 

**Independent Studies**: I also supervise independent studies. Write me a brief email outlining the topic and your research interest.
