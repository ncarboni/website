# PhD


My research group investigates topics across digital heritage/humanities, cultural analytics, and informatics, with a focus on developing computational tools and methods for studying the significance of our heritage.

I welcome students who are interested in working on **cultural transmission**, **patrimonialization**, **heritage documentation** (both tangible and intangible), and **collections as data**, using methods/techniques from data science, network science, computer vision, or knowledge graph (or a mix of the above).

If you have a strong programming background that's great, but it is not an hard requirement. I also value students with strong humanistic training, particularly in fields like art history, cultural studies, or heritage science. Above all, I value curiosity and interdisciplinarity. 

If you're thinking about joining the group, feel free to send me a brief email outlining your research interests. You can reach me at carboni at illinois dot edu. While I may not be able to reply to every message, I do keep track of expressions of interest.

For those interested in working with me, the best way is to [apply to the PhD program at the iSchool](https://ischool.illinois.edu/degrees-programs/graduate/phd-information-sciences/apply) and list me as an advisor.
 

# Other opportunities 

**RAships**: Occasionally I may have paid research opportunities for students (both graduate and undergraduate). When I do, I circulate them to relevant departments/school on campus, on LinkedIn and here. 

**Independent Studies**: I also supervise independent studies. Write me a brief email outlining the topic and your research interest.

**PostDoc**: The iSchool offers a few Postdoctoral Research Associate position each year, with details and deadlines typically announced in February. If you're interested in applying and would like to discuss potential mentorship, feel free to write me.
