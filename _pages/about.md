Hi, I'm <b>Nicola Carboni</b>, an Assistant Professor in [Information Science](https://ischool.illinois.edu/) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I work at the intersection of knowledge representation and data analysis, using **computational methods for modelling, integrating, and interpreting historical and cultural data**. My current work focuses on the spatiotemporal analysis of exhibition information and the investigation of temporal and spatial variables in literary sources. 
I previously worked on image globalization, the semantic exploration of iconographical patterns, and the data-driven analysis of Burckhardtâ€™s epistolary corpus. Before joining the University of Illinois, he held position as Postdoctoral Researcher in Digital Humanities at the [University of Geneva](https://www.unige.ch/lettres/humanites-numeriques/equipe/collaborateurs/nicola-carboni), Digital Humanities Fellow at the [iTatti Harvard Center for Italian Renaissance Studies](https://itatti.harvard.edu/people/nicola-carboni), and Research Fellow and Semantic Architect for the Swiss Art Research Infrastructure (SARI) at the [University of Zurich](https://www.sari.uzh.ch/en/organisation/alumni/nicola-carboni.html).

I completed my PhD in Engineering, on the topic of [conceptualization and semantic description in digitized tangible/intangible content](http://dx.doi.org/10.26240/heal.ntua.18578) at NTUA (National Technical University of Athens) in conjunction with the [MAP Laboratory](https://www.map.cnrs.fr/en/) at the CNRS (National Research Center of France) where he was also previously appointed Marie Curie Early Stage Research fellow.
