  abstract = {As ontologies grow in complexity and breadth, domain experts often struggle to understand their intricacies without the assistance of semantic experts. As a result, the ontologies themselves can become significant obstacles in constructing reusable and consistent knowledge graphs of their data following these standards. To address these challenges, this contribution presents the Semantic Reference Data Model (SRDM) modelling method, a protocol that offers a practical approach to (i) simplifying ontological complexity, (ii) standardising semantic patterns and (iii) facilitating the creation of new knowledge graphs. SRDM provides a solution for overcoming conceptual challenges by offering a catalogue of entity-based templates, whereby recognisable entities within a domain are documented in single templates composed of ready-made and distinct ontological patterns covering the entity\&rsquo;s most documented attributes. The limited number of elements available, the use of domain-specific language, and the correspondence between documented objects and real-world items make the SRDMs particularly easy to grasp, helping bridge the gap between semantic and domain experts. A case study is used to illustrate the framework\&rsquo;s application in the cultural sector, specifically highlighting the advantages obtained in documentation, data consistency, and external data ingestion. The case study demonstrates how SRDMs can vastly simplify the creation and management of knowledge graphs, helping Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage communities easily share essential and useful datasets.},

This chapter reviews the multiple approaches undertaken to address this problem, finally proposing CIDOC CRM as the most robust solution for information integration in CH. The chapter begins by outlining the data challenge specific to the field and the main approaches that can be taken in facing it. Within this frame, it distinguishes knowledge engineering and formal ontology from other information modelling techniques as the necessary approach for tackling the broader data integration problem. It then outlines the basic principles of CIDOC CRM, the ISO standard formal ontology for CH. From there, an overview is given of some of the work that has been done both theoretically and in practice over the past five years in developing and implementing CRM as a practical data integration strategy in CH, particularly looking at model extensions to handle knowledge provenance across various disciplines and typical documentation and reasoning activities, as well as at successful implementation projects. Lastly, it summarizes the present potentials and challenges for using CIDOC CRM for solving the CH data management and integration puzzle. The intended audience of this chapter are specialists from all backgrounds within the broader domain of CH with an interest in data integration and CIDOC CRM.},

The creation of a product that can be re-used scientifically requires a framework for consistent, standardised documentation of the entire digitisation pipeline. This article provides an analysis of the problems inherent to such goals and presents a series of protocols to document the various steps of a photogrammetric workflow. We propose this pipeline, with descriptors to track all phases of digital product creation in order to assure data provenance and enable the validation of the operations from an analytic and production perspective. The approach aims to support adopters of the workflow to define procedures with a long term perspective. The conceptual schema we present is founded on an analysis of information and actor exchanges in the digitisation process. The metadata were defined through the synthesis of previous proposals in this area and were tested on a case study. We performed the digitisation of a set of cultural heritage artefacts from an Iron Age burial in Ilmendorf, Germany. The objects were captured and processed using different techniques, including a comparison of different imaging tools and algorithms. This augmented the complexity of the process allowing us to test the flexibility of the schema for documenting complex scenarios. Although we have only presented a photogrammetry digitisation scenario, we claim that our schema is easily applicable to a multitude of 3D documentation processes.},

Exhibition catalogs often document the address used by an artist participating in exhibitions. The analysis of this information offers significant insights into the spatial and social dimensions of artistic communities. However, the time-bound nature of the information makes its modeling particularly challenging, as it requires a framework that can effectively represent both the spatial and temporal dimensions of the relation. The connection between artist and their address, in fact, is always a fluent, a relationships that only hold within specific time intervals. To overcome this challenge, the study proposes and compares three ontological patterns designed for formalizing the dynamic aspects of spatial, temporal, and conceptual characteristics of an entity. The three approaches, based on RDF-star, CIDOC-CRM, and 4D ontology, are evaluated based on their ability to accurately represent the diachronic nature of addresses, formalizing (whether implicitly or explicitly) the validity of spatiotemporal assertions, and facilitating data integration and analysis.},

Developed using CIDOC-CRM, a de-facto standard ontology in the heritage domain, the model specifies ontological patterns for documenting key aspects of exhibitions, such as their temporal duration, spatial extension, mereological structures, source of knowledge, the role of its participants and the function of the artwork exposed. The adoption of the proposed model facilitates the integration and analysis of diverse exhibition data, enabling a comprehensive and richer understanding of the spatial, temporal, and participatory dimensions of each exhibition, helping to contextualize their reach and impact within the global artistic milieu, and enabling better data-driven studies in digital art history and cultural analytics.},

Drawing upon recent scholarship on visual culture and intertextuality, we investigate Tacita Dean’s publication Buon fresco, an artist book (London, mack, 2016) drawn from the homonymous film (2014), which is composed of close-up details from Giotto’s fresco cycle depicting The Life of Saint Francis in the Upper Basilica of Saint Francis at Assisi. The frescos have been the subjects of various analyses, which have highlighted a multiplicity of meanings. Among them, a recent one by medieval historian Chiara Frugoni (2011, 2015) uses a similar approach to Dean’s, which focuses on close-ups based on techniques of photoreproduction and enlargement, and gives the viewers an innovative perspective on the work by making them virtually climb onto the medieval scaffolding. Curiously enough, Dean and Frugoni choose analogous fragments but give contrasting readings. The polysemic nature of the work is documented through the creation of a digital atlas that represents the diverse macro and micro readings of the text. The article explores how digital data can be used to illustrate a pictorial text, making evident the interconnections between the multitude of primary (denotation) and secondary (connotation) referents, and underlining how differences in cultural sensibility can result in the examination of various facets of a pictorial text as well as in divergent interpretations.},

In a rapidly modernizing society, where periodicals, catalogs, and printed books made images increasingly accessible, printed reproductions played an often-overlooked role in shaping the reception of artists. One question we examine is whether artwork reproductions in the press contributed to the broader dissemination of artistic culture—through references to past cultural icons (Old Masters, historical artistic styles) or contemporary creation. Contrary to Walter Benjamin’s concerns about the “loss of aura” in mechanically reproduced art, did the circulation of printed reproductions actually enhance the aura of certain artworks and artists as their images reached wider audiences? The study identifies over 5,000 art images that circulated internationally between the 1880s and 1960s in a larger corpus of 14.2 million images. These art images rarely crossed social boundaries and were likely consumed by elite audiences. However, we do not conclude that the aura was necessarily maintained by this circulation within elite circles. Some images were likely disseminated more due to commercial and technical factors rather than considerations of taste or admiration for the artists.},

Despite its global turn (cultural transfers, postcolonial and decolonial approaches), art history has essentially been content with monographic studies—images in circulation, hybrid motifs, and stylistic crossbreeding. Methods and questions of global art history have remained focused on the specificity of individual case studies, possibly due to the colossal amount of material and inadequate analytical instruments. However, thanks to the increasing availability of digital material and the growing analytical capacities of computational tools, we are finally able to examine the globalization of images in its full extent. The Visual Contagions project takes advantage of these novel digital methods to analyze the global circulation of images in illustrated prints. Nevertheless, the mere use of a digital eye fed with a corpus of international images is not sufficient to provide a distant and complete view of the globalization of images. To overcome the limitations of the machine, it is crucial to introduce art-historical knowledge and to adapt traditional research methodologies to the computational process. In this article, we present our findings, showcasing the limitations rooted in the nature of digital methodology itself, and how they constrain what the digital eye allows us to observe or prevents us from seeing. We reflect upon novel ways of understanding globalization, on the significancy of our sources, and on how the way we classify them can change our perspectives of global circulation.},

  abstract = {Illustrated journals are available digitally in unprecedented quantities, and on a global scale. As such, they provide the ideal foundation to examine globalization logics in the history of art and literature through the prism of ‘distant reading and viewing’. When articulated and completed by more traditional close reading of the sources, a computational approach can raise new questions about the international circulation of images in illustrated periodicals. It may help to reinterpret, and even better understand, the variety of flows and imbalances in the international circulation of images, that are often taken too quickly as evidence of centrality or peripherality. This paper presents the perspectives opened by the Visual Contagions project (SNSF, University of Geneva, CH), which analyses images from thousands of illustrated periodicals published worldwide from the 1890s to the 1990s. Images do not magically circulate, nor do styles ‘diffuse’ and provide evidence of ‘influences’, as it is often assumed. The computational approach is used to analyse avant-garde periodicals, and it allowed us to highlight networks of image exchange, affinities between magazines, countries, and cultural or social milieus. Such methodologies emphasize the social logics that promoted the circulation of images and styles, and unveil the authorial or distributive role of some key publications in the avant-garde; but they also reveal and help understand image diffusions that were previously difficult to explain other than by a Zeitgeist, by the notion of centres and peripheries, or by a formalist approach that consolidated the non-questioned domination of European canons.},

  abstract = {The outcomes of virtual reconstructions of archaeological monuments are not just images for aesthetic consumption but rather present a scholarly argument and decision making process. They are based on complex chains of reasoning grounded in primary and secondary evidence that enable a historically probable whole to be reconstructed from the partial remains left in the archaeological record. This paper will explore the possibilities for documenting and storing in an information system the phases of the reasoning, decision and procedures that a modeler, with the support of an archaeologist, uses during the virtual reconstruction process and how they can be linked to the reconstruction output. The goal is to present a documentation model such that the foundations of evidence for the reconstructed elements, and the reasoning around them, are made not only explicit and interrogable but also can be updated, extended and reused by other researchers in future work. Using as a case-study the reconstruction of a kitchen in a Roman domus in Grand, we will examine the necessary documentation requirements, and the capacity to express it using semantic technologies. For our study we adopt the CIDOC-CRM ontological model, and its extensions CRMinf, CRMBa and CRMgeo as a starting point for modelling the arguments and relations.},

  abstract = {With this White Paper, which gathers contributions from more than 25 experts of 3D imaging, modellng and processing, as well as professionals concerned with the interoperability and sustainability of research data, the PARTHENOS project aims at laying the foundations of a comprehensive environment centered on the researchers' practices concerning 3D digital objects. The topics addressed in the document are meant to help to ensure the development of standardized good practices relating to the production, the handling, the long-term conservation and the reuse of 3D objects. Therefore, even if the focus is put on technical questions (formats, processing, and annotation), the White Paper also identifies the need to clarify the legal status of 3D objects, in order to facilitate their reuse(s) in non-research contexts, in particular in Museums.},

  abstract = {3D digitization, based on active or passive sensors, is a need for all man-made or natural heritage structures. It is indeed important to digitally preserve our past using the latest ICT solutions to protect and valorize it. This paper presents a collaborative work for the 3D surveying of a complex heritage monument, its annotation and segmentation for semantic reasons and the final access on the web for dissemination and valorization purposes. We report a scalable methodology for 3D surveying and exploration of large 3D results. The case study is a large castle decorated with frescoes and ornamental elements which was surveyed using photogrammetry. The 3D results (dense coloured point clouds) are enriched with metadata and historical information and shared on the Internet using a customized point-based viewer.},
