I will be presenting **"Integrating Computational and Historical Methods for Investigating Image Circulations"** at the workshop '[Encoding the Image: How does AI affect the Future of Photo History?](https://theimagecentre.ca/symposium/imc-forum-encoding-the-image/)' at the Image Centre in Toronto.
